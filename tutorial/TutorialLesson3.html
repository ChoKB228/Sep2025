<p><i>Once upon a time, an old woman baked a 
gingerbread man. When she opened the oven, the gingerbread man 
jumped out and ran away, shouting,
"<u>Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't
catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man!</u>"</i>
</p>
</font>

<font size=5 face=Tamaho color=green>
<p><i>The woman and her husband chased
him, but he was too quick. Soon, a cow
tried to catch him, then a horse, and
even some farmers-but none could catch the Gingerbread Man.
</p></font>

<font size=5 face=Tamaho color=red>
<p><i>At last, the Ginderbread Man reached a
river. He couldn't swim, then a crocodile
offered him a hand. "<u>Hop on my back...
I'll carry you across the river...</u>" said the crocodile.
The Gingerbread Man hop on the crocodile back.
"<u>Ha! Ha! Ha! You will never catch me I'm the 
Gingerbread Man</u>"said The Ginderbread Man.

<p><i>
But then, halfway across the river.The crocodile
tossed the Gingerbread Man upwards and with a single <big>"CHOMP!"</big>.
The Gingerbread Man was no more.</i></p></font>
